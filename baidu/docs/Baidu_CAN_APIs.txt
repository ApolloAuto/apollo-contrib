version 3.0.0.1:

The APIs below are meant to be generic and are not tied to any specific CAN
hardware. However some of the APIs are specific to Baidu CAN
(specifically noted below) and are exposed to advanced users.

======================================================
1. CAN CHANNEL ACCESS:
======================================================
1.1)
int bcan_open(uint32_t dev_index, uint32_t flags, uint64_t tx_timeout, uint64_t
    rx_timeout, bcan_hdl_t *hdl)

This call will return a logical handle 'hdl' to a physical CAN interface. The
CAN channel is identified by 'dev_index' which should correspond to
/dev/zcan_pio# (this dev entry name might change in future but should be
completely transparent to user).
'tx_timeout' is the timeout in ms for bcan_send(). Set to 0 for no timeout.
'rx_timeout' is the timeout in ms for bcan_recv(). Set to 0 for no timeout.
'flags' is TBD.

Return value: 0 on success, error code (see Section 5) on failure.

1.2)
int bcan_close(bcan_hdl_t hdl)

This call will close the logical handle 'hdl'.

Return value: 0 on success, error code (see Section 5) on failure.

1.3)
int bcan_start(bcan_hdl_t hdl)

This call will initialize the channel and put it in a state ready for transmitting
and receiving CAN frames.

For Baidu CAN: This will put the card in 'NORMAL' mode.
Return value: 0 on success, error code (see Section 5) on failure.

1.4)
int bcan_stop(bcan_hdl_t hdl)

This call will stop any data from being received or transmitted on this channel.
Error counter and status registers will be reset.

For Baidu CAN: This will put it in CONFIGURATION mode. Initial state after reset. Error
counter and Status registers are reset. Cannot receive or transmit messages. Reads
from the RX FIFO and writes to TX FIFO and HPB are ok.

Return value: 0 on success, error code (see Section 5) on failure.

1.5)
const char* bcan_get_libversion(void)

This call return current libbcan version as a string.

======================================================
2. CHANNEL CONFIGURATION
======================================================
2.1)
int bcan_set_baudrate(bcan_hdl_t hdl, uint32_t rate)

Specify 'rate' using one of the below supported values (defined in bcan.h). For
e.g. BCAN_BAUDRATE_500K means 500Kbps.

BCAN_BAUDRATE_150K
BCAN_BAUDRATE_250K
BCAN_BAUDRATE_500K
BCAN_BAUDRATE_1M

Return value: 0 on success, error code (see Section 5) on failure.

2.2)
int bcan_get_baudrate(bcan_hdl_t hdl, uint32_t *rate)

This call will return the current baudrate in Kbps via 'rate'.
Return value: 0 on success, error code (see Section 5) on failure.

2.3)
int bcan_set_loopback(bcan_hdl_t hdl)

This API will cause all messages sent on Tx to be received on Rx. This is
effectively a self-test mode. Note all CAN devices may not support this mode.

Return value: 0 on success, error code (see Section 5) on failure.

2.4)
int bcan_unset_loopback(bcan_hdl_t hdl)

This call will stop the loopback mode and will return the channel to normal
operational mode.

Return value: 0 on success, error code (see Section 5) on failure.

======================================================
3. DATA PATH
======================================================
typedef struct bcan_msg {
        uint32_t	bcan_msg_id; 	    // source CAN node id
        uint8_t		bcan_msg_rsv[3];    // reserved for future
        uint8_t		bcan_msg_datalen;   // message data length
        uint8_t		bcan_msg_data[8];   // message data
        struct timeval	bcan_msg_timestamp;
} bcan_msg_t;

3.1)
int bcan_recv(bcan_hdl_t hdl, bcan_msg_t *buf, uint32_t num_msg)

This call will return with either the requested number of messages 'num_msg' or
the number of available messages in the RX FIFO, which ever is smaller. If Rx
FIFO is empty this function will block until at least one message is received.
The 'rx_timeout' value specified in bcan_open() will be enforced by this call.
Caller is responsible for making sure 'buf' contains enough space for the requested
number of messages. 'num_msg' should not exceed BCAN_MAX_RX_MSG.

On success this call will return the number of messages received. A error code
(see Section 5) is returned on failure.

3.2)
int bcan_send(bcan_hdl_t hdl, bcan_msg_t *buf, uint32_t num_msg)

'num_msg' is the number of CAN messages to be sent. 'num_msg' should not exceed
BCAN_MAX_TX_MSG. The 'tx_timeout' specified in bcan_open() will be enforced by
this call.

Return value: On success this call will return the number of messages transmitted.
Note that success does not mean message was put on the bus, it simply means message
has been enqueued in the Tx FIFO.  A error code (see Section 5) is returned on
failure.

3.3)
int bcan_send_hi_pri(bcan_hdl_t hdl, bcan_msg_t *buf);
Baidu CAN specific. Only 1 high priority message can be sent at a time.
'tx_timeout' specified in bcan_open() does not apply to this call. Instead this
call will return immediately with either success or failure.

Return value: On success this call will return the number of messages transmitted
which is 1. A error code (see Section 5) is returned on failure.

======================================================
4. DIAGNOSTIC:
======================================================
Baidu CAN specific.

4.1)
int bcan_get_status(bcan_hdl_t hdl)

This call will return the overall status of the channel hardware. A error code
(defined in section 5) is returned on error.

The following macros are available to retrieve specific fields in the Status
register, 'value' is the return value from bcan_get_status().

BCAN_GET_FIFO_STATUS(value) -> returns Acceptance filter status, Tx FIFO and
	High Priority Buffer status.

BCAN_GET_ERR_STATUS(value) -> returns error active, error passive or bus off state.

BCAN_GET_BUS_STATUS(value) -> returns Busy or Idle

BCAN_GET_MODE_STATUS(value) -> returns Normal, Sleep, Loopback, Configuration

4.2)
int bcan_get_err_counter(bcan_hdl_t hdl, uint8_t *rx_err_counter, uint8_t *tx_err_counter)

After this call 'rx_err_counter' and 'tx_err_counter' will contain the
respective values from the Error Count register. These values are a indicator
of the health of the CAN controller and bus.

Return value: 0 on success, error code (see Section 5) on failure.

======================================================
5. Version & Build Info
======================================================
5.1)
const char *bcan_get_libversion(void)

Return bcan library version; e.g., "3.0.0.1".

======================================================
6. Error codes
======================================================
6.1)
const char *bcan_get_err_msg(int err_code);

Return error message corresponding to the given error code.

6.2)
List of error code; all values below are negative.

- BCAN_HDL_INVALID
	Handle is not valid.

- BCAN_DEV_INVALID
	Device is not in a suitable state for this operation. For e.g. calling
bcan_send() without calling bcan_start().

- BCAN_DEV_ERR
	Device has entered a error state. For e.g. bcan_send() can fail if
device has entered 'Bus Off' state.

- BCAN_DEV_BUSY
	Device is busy, re-try after some time. For e.g. setting loopback mode
when device is actively transmitting or receiving in normal mode.

- BCAN_NOT_SUPPORTED
	Operation not supported

- BCAN_NOT_IMPLEMENTED
	Operation not implemented.

- BCAN_PARAM_INVALID
	One or more of the input parameters (other than the handle) is not valid.

- BCAN_NO_BUFFERS
	Either a hardware or software buffer is not available for this
operation. For e.g. bcan_send() could fail if Tx hardware/software resources
are all occupied.

- BCAN_ERR
	Catch-all error
