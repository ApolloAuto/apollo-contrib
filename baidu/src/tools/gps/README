usage:

0. This is working with ADU HW2.0, particularly with PP6+FPGA setup.

1. Put a 5min crontab, as
*/5 * * * * root date >> /var/log/gps_sync.log; baidu_gps_time -s >> /var/log/gps_sync.log 2>&1;
for continuous adjustments of GPS time and host time drift. Expected << 1ms.

2. Invoke baidu_gps_time -s before adv_trigger, so we have a GPS synced host time before triggering sensors, e.g. cameras;
 
3. One can also run manually anytime as: (need root permission)
set host time to gps time:
baidu_gps_time -s  

get gps time:
baidu_gps_time -p

get GPRMC msg from gps:
baidu_gps_time -m

for help:
baidu_gps_time -h

4. In case of gps not in locked status, the program retries 10 times (1 sec per try), and might give up;
One can re-run it at later time.
