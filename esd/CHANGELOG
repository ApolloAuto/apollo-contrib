                      version of the library is binary incompatible with the
                      old version 3.x releases and requires recompilation of
                      all applications. The new version also introduces

                      64-bit capable ISA system.
          28.08.2015  Release of 3.10.1 for ISA331 for Linux (x86, x86_64)    STM
                      The x86_64 variant can't be testet due to lack of a
                      64-bit capable ISA/PC104 system.
          28.08.2015  Release of 3.10.1 for PCI200 for Linux (x86, x86_64)    STM

                      changes to fix defects for timing corner cases found
                      during the certification process.

          04.07.2006  Numerical setting of baudrate for USB331 and 82527      AB

          29.06.2006  Linux-Bugfix: Under certain bus error conditions        AB
                      it was possible, that a canWrite() returned too
                      early (reporting zero frames sent) and a subsequent
                      canWrite() reported too many sent frames (the ones
                      from the job before). This bug did _not_ lead to
                      unsent frames or lost data.

          29.06.2006  SJA1000-Bugfix: Under certain bus error conditions      AB
                      it was possible, that an old frame was sent,
                      although user job was already aborted.

          29.06.2006  Added features:                                         AB
                      - Autobaud (automatic baudrate detection)
                        Currently usable with: SJA1000
                                               REMOTE-I/F
                                               MSCAN
                      - Baudrate change event
                      - Numerical setting of baudrate (calculation of
                        BTR values)
                        Currently usable with: I20 (all except USB331)
                                               SJA1000
                                               REMOTE-I/F
                                               MSCAN
                      - Extended error information event
                        Currently generated by: SJA1000
                                                REMOTE-I/F
                        NOTE: This feature adds some load to your system
                              in error conditions (should be negligible,
                              though).
                              The behaviour in error conditions has
                              changed (frames might get aborted before
                              timeout due to bus errors). New error code
                              NTCAN_CONTR_ERR_PASSIVE.
                        NOTE: Under Linux this feature can be
                              disabled with errorinfo=0 as module
                              load parameter.
                       - Type of CAN-controller is reported in upmost byte
                         of board_status (canStatus())

                      - added use of hardware timestamping with
                        firmwares > 0.C.4E

          28.04.2006  Linux USB331:                                           AB
                      - output of serial number is supported, now
                      - changed to work with kernels >= 2.6.14

          24.04.2006  Changes for Linux kernel > 2.6.10:                      AB
                      - use of compat_ioctl
                        (needed for 32-Bit appplications on 64-Bit systems)
                      - use of unlocked_ioctl
                        (might result in performance advantage on SMP
                         systems)

                      with Linux (on PPC/cpci405: esdcan.c)

                      Pass ARCH=... to kernel make process to allow
                      cross compilation with 2.6 kernels

          06.12.2005  I20-Bugfix: Possible deadlock on driver unload          AB
                      This bug needed several things to occurr
                      simultaneously:
                        - slow host system
                        - multiple PCI331
                        - high load directly before unloading the driver

  3.6.2   05.12.2005  Release of version 3.6.2 for pci331 for RTX 6.x         OT

  3.6.2   05.12.2005  Release of version 3.6.2 for pci405 for RTX 6.x         OT

  3.6.0   08.11.2005  Release of version 3.6.0 for isa200 for Linux           AB

  3.6.1   03.11.2005  Release of version 3.6.1 for pci200 for Linux           AB

  3.6.2   03.11.2005  Release of version 3.6.2 for pci405 for Linux           AB

          03.11.2005  Fixed reinitialization of CAN-controller, if            AB
                      canSetBaudrate() is called twice with the same
                      baudrate (bug was introduced with last release,
                      version 3.6.1 of pci405 appeared in public, only)

  3.6.1   01.11.2005  Release of version 3.6.1 for pci405 for Linux           AB

          31.10.2005  Fixed 800kBit baudrate for SJA1000.                     AB

          31.10.2005  Minor bugfix. When driver was used in "smart            AB
                      disconnect" mode (driver load option), the driver
                      removes a controller from the CAN-bus, if there were
                      no more open handles. Nevertheless canGetBaudrate()
                      delivered the last configured baudrate. This is fixed.

          27.10.2005  Linux:                                                  AB
                      Added support for NTCAN_IOCTL_GET_SERIAL
                      Added support for NTCAN_IOCTL_SET_RX_TIMEOUT
                      Added support for NTCAN_IOCTL_SET_TX_TIMEOUT

          27.10.2005  Fixed bug with CAN-frames with length greater eight     AB
                      82527 boards.

          21.10.2005  Some internal changes concerning future extensions     MF+MT
                      of the CAN driver (no influence on existing
                      features).

          20.10.2005  Linux and pci405 all platforms:
                      Fixed bug in 20B-Filter (introduced with 3.6.0 release) MT

          14.09.2005  Fixed bug with CAN-frames with length greater eight     MK
                      for SJA1000 boards.
                      Such frames shouldn't be used, but nevertheless the
                      CAN specification allows such frames and thus these
                      are correctly supported.

  3.6.1   30.08.2005  Release of version 3.6.1 for pci331 (Linux64)           AB

          29.08.2005  Fixed small bug in PCI-hotplug layer (introduced        AB
                       with release 3.6.0 of PCI360), concerning mapping
                       of unwanted IO-spaces on pci200 and pci331

  3.6.0   23.08.2005  Release of version 3.6.0 for pci360 (Linux)             AB

          22.08.2005  NEW TYPE for CAN handles: NTCAN_HANDLE.                 AB
                      HANDLE is deprecated from now on!
                      This change got necessary to keep ntcan-library on
                      all systems compatible with ntcan-library for vxWorks.

          22.08.2005  Fixed bug in PCI-hotplug layer concerning disabled      AB
                       memory spaces (affecting pci360, only) (Linux)

          22.08.2005  Small bugfix concerning canIdDelete (Linux)             AB

  3.6.0   26.07.2005  Release of verson 3.6.0 for isa331 (Linux)              AB

          26.07.2005  Major changes in system abstraction layer for linux     AB
                      - PCI driver is hotplug driver, now (driver didn't
                        receive interrupts at all on certain ACPI systems)
                      - Cleaned the entire layer and made it more modular

          26.07.2005  Minor bugfix for Linux/ISA drivers (better validation   AB
                       of IO-address)

          26.07.2005  Minor bugfix in ISA initialization                      AB
                      Problem occurred only with severeal address spaces
                      (which we currently don't have on any hardware)

          19.07.2005  One driver-binary can serve different hardware now      AB
                      (Used for sja1000 derivates under linux at the moment:
                       PCI200 driver serves for PCI200, PCI266 and CPCI200)

  3.6.0   18.07.2005  Release of version 3.6.0 for pci405 (Windows)           MF

          14.07.2005  New 20B-Filter                                          MT
                      Note: 20B filtering was possible before, this
                            corresponds to a more sophisticated way of
                            filtering with two masks ("as one wants it to
                            have"), see CAN-API manual.
